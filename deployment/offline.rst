The quickest and most simple way to run THOR is by providing the ZIP
archive to the colleagues in the remote location, letting them run the
THOR executable and collect the report files afterwards.

The most usable format in this use case is the HTML report if only a few
reports have to be analyzed. If the number of collected reports is high,
we recommend using ASGARD Analysis Cockpit or Splunk with the free App
and Add-on.
