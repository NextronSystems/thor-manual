Velociraptor
============

We created `Velociraptor artifacts <https://github.com/NextronSystems/velociraptor-artifacts-thor>`_,
which you can use within your Velociraptor environment to run
THOR and collect its output.

We also wrote a `blog article <https://www.nextron-systems.com/2023/11/03/integration-of-thor-in-velociraptor-supercharging-digital-forensics-and-incident-response/>`_
which explains how this integration works in more detail.
