THOR Cloud
==========

**THOR Cloud** is a cloud service which allows you to download
and run THOR on multiple endpoints with a single binary, without
installing an agent. This avoids the pain of distributing THOR
and collecting its output in bigger environments, as you can just
run the launcher binary and watch the scan slowly finish.
