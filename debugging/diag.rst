Diagnostics Pack
----------------

THOR Util comes with the functionality to collect a diagnostics pack for
THOR scans. This is helpful if a scan is taking more time as expected
or if THOR exits unexpectedly. More details can be found in the
`diagnostics section of THOR Util <https://thor-util-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/usage/diagnostics.html>`_.
