THOR Logs
=========

This chapter explains the possibilities for collecting and analyzing
THOR logs.

ASGARD Analysis Cockpit
-----------------------

The **ASGARD Analysis Cockpit** is the central platform for analyzing THOR logs. It
can be used in an environment where scans are controlled by the ASGARD
Management Center and can also be used where THOR is executed manually
or controlled by third party solutions. It is available as a virtual
appliance on VMWare and also as a dedicated hardware appliance.

THOR can also be seen or used as hunting solution, it is optimized to
avoid false negatives â€“ meaning optimized to not miss an indicator of
compromise. On the other side this clearly leads to more anomalies and
false positives being reported.

In a scenario where you scan your infrastructure frequently you would
either be seeing the same anomalies again and again or you would need to
create many rules to filter out these anomalies in order to save
analysis time.

The ASGARD Analysis Cockpit is designed to facilitate this process and help you
generate these rules automatically, so that you can set your
baseline-filters after the first scan. After setting the first baseline
it is now easy to focus on relevant Alerts and Warnings as only
differences between the first and second scans are shown.

The ASGARD Analysis Cockpit comes with an integrated and highly configurable
ticketing system that helps organizing your analysis workflow.
Furthermore, the ASGARD Analysis Cockpit comes with a rule based alert
forwarding and SIEM integration that makes it easy for your organization
to react quickly on new incidents.

We offer a THOR Splunk App and Add-on via the official Splunk App Store.
This App helps you to extract the event fields and provides dashboards
to get a better overview on distributed runs on multiple systems.

THOR Util Report Feature
------------------------

THOR Util provides a feature called "report" that creates HTML reports
from text logs of one or more scanned systems.

Log Analysis Manual
-------------------

We have written a detailed Log Analysis Manual which:

* Explains how to analyze THOR logs
* Contains example logs
* Lists potential false positives you might encounter
* And how different attributes are to be evaluated
