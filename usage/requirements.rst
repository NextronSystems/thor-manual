Requirements
============

THOR runs in any Windows, Linux and macOS environment without any
further requirements. Everything needed is already included in the
program package.

To use the full potential of THOR, you should execute it with administrative
privileges - ``LOCAL_SYSTEM`` on Windows and ``root`` on Linux/macOS
systems.

Operating Systems
-----------------

The following operating systems and their versions are the **minimum
requirements** to run THOR. Any newer version will also work with THOR.

any problems, we will not be able to fix them. Contact us for

* RHEL Linux 4
* Citrix Netscaler
* ICS environments with Windows XP embedded systems (planned)
* VMWare ESX (see this `blog post <https://www.nextron-systems.com/2021/06/07/analyze-vmware-esx-systems-with-thor-thunderstorm/>`__)

Update Servers
--------------

To download the newest updates for THOR and our signatures, you need an active internet connection.
The endpoint performing the update needs to reach our update servers to do this.

For a detailed and up to date list of our update and licensing
servers, please visit https://www.nextron-systems.com/hosts/.

.. hint::
  You do not need an active internet connection to scan an endpoint. This is only needed
  if you want to update to the latest THOR and signature versions. There are special
  licenses for special circumstances, for example when the licensed system does not
  have internet access.
