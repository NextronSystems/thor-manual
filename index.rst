Nextron Systems - THOR Scanner
==============================

Welcome to Nextron System's Manual for THOR 11.

This document contains information about the usage of THOR 11.

.. note::
   You will encounter command line arguments or even full commands
   used for THOR in this manual. The paths specified for those arguments
   are just examples (like ``C:\thor``), and you should adjust them
   accordingly to your needs.
   
   We also use examples for Windows and/or Linux throughout the manual.
   All the binaries are available for every operating system, but with
   different names. Inspect the THOR directory and choose accordingly.
   Any command line arguments used can (mostly) be used on any operating
   system.
