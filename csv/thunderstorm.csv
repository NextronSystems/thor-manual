Parameter;Values;Function
**--thor-binary**;path to executable;Specify the location of the THOR binary that is used for scanning samples (default is the binary from the same package)
**--host**;ip address;IP address that the Thunderstorm server should bind to (default ``127.0.0.1``)
**--port**;port number;TCP port that the Thunderstorm server should bind to (default ``8080``)
**--cert**;.crt location;TLS certificate that the Thunderstorm server should use. If left empty, TLS is not used
**--key**;.key location;Private key for the TLS certificate that the Thunderstorm server should use. Required if ``--cert`` is specified
**--upload-dir**;directory;Path to a directory where THOR drops malicious files (see ``--store-samples-score``).
**--store-samples-score**;score;All samples with at least this score will be stored permanently in the folder specified with ``--upload-dir``.
**--result-cache-size**;number of results;Size of the cache that is used to store results of asynchronous requests temporarily. If set to 0, the cache is disabled and asynchronous results are not stored. (default ``10000``)
**--queue-warn-size**;number of samples;Thunderstorm will issue a warning when the queue for asynchronous requests exceeds this value (this indicates more data influx than Thunderstorm can handle)
**--vfs-dir**;path;Thunderstorm will create a per-host directory structure under this path that contains all stored samples (see ``--store-samples-score``) in the subpaths as they existed on the original hosts.
